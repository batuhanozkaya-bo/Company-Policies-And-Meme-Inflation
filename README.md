# Company-Policies-And-Meme-Inflation

This project investigates that major algorithm changes on "For You" pages and introduction of vertical short-video user interfaces (e.g. Instagram Reels) on social media platforms cause lifespan of new meme trends to decrease.

## Data Collection

Google Trends API, APIs of social media platforms (X, Reddit etc.) and web scraping from KnowYourMeme.com might be used to gather data related to meme trends lifespan, their origin platform etc.

Major algorithm and UI changes are posted on the websites of the social media platforms with their dates; therefore, this does not require any special data gathering method.

Certain thresholds will be defined to decide whether a meme is on trends or not. Other data will be used to get average lifespan of memes that emerged before and after these changes.
